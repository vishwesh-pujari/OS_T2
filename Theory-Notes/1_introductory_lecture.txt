We will focus on Unix-like OS architectures.
OS means course on Kernel. Kernel is the piece of Code that connects hardware + software.
OS = Kernel + Compiler + Loader + Linker + Shell. 
Shell is not a part of kernel.

In an era of "Data Science" why study "Operating Systems"?:
Fashion is temporary, class is permanent! Technologies keep on changing, core courses are constant.

DO NOT neglect any core course in Computer Engineering.
Veritas, IBM, Microsoft, Amazon(AWS), Oracle, VMWare, Intel, HP, Honeywell offer OS Jobs.
Cloud is Advanced Operating System problem.
